        Calculation starts with addition of every number in your date of birth. In this case, 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 32.

        Then, you again add the individual digits of the resultant number until you get the final single digit number which is your life path number.

        There is an exception on which case if you arrive at the result of 22 or 11, you should not further reduce the numbers as 4 or 2 because 22 and 11 are consider as the master numbers. 

        So, if you arrive at the result of 11 or 22, then that is your life path number

        [A, J, S] => 1; [B, K, T] => 2; [C, L, U] => 3; [D, M, V] => 4; [E, N, W] => 5; [F, O, X] => 6; [G, P, Y] => 7; [H, Q, T] => 8; [I, R] => 9;

        For instance, The name 'Seenu' has the destiny number as 1 (1 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 19 = 1 + 9 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1). 
        
        Note that the number should be reduced to a single number by adding the individual digits of a previous resultant except for 11 and 22 which are master numbers
